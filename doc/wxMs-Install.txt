Installing wxMS

Once you have downloaded the installer, simply run it.

It will install wxMS and any files needed to run it in the
directory of your choice. It will also produce a desktop
icon for your convenience.

Uninstalling wxMS

In case you want to uninstall wxMS from your machine, simply run the 
uninstall entry from the start menu. All files, except the .INI and 
log file, if any, will be removed. If you decided to not use the 
program any longer, you can remove the whole entry, although in that 
case you would have to reconfigure the program again, if you decide to 
use it again later.

Additional Software  Requirements

All OSes may will require you to install the Microsoft Visual C++ 
2010 Redistributable Package (x86) from
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/confirmation.aspx?id=5555
This package installs MSCVP100.DLL & MSVCR100.dll

Windows 8.x
Due to lack of a Windows 8 system, wxMS has not been tested under 
Windows 8, though it is expected to install and run without 
problems.
If you experience any issues, please contact the author.

Windows 10
wxMS has been installed under Windows 10 and runs with the 
redistributable package installed.
   
Running the Program:

This information is also provided in the help system.

First time set-up.

When you run wxMS for the first time, or if you delete or rename it's 
.INI file, you will need to enter some basic information needed for 
the program to run and do its job.

As a minimum you will need to know:

 - POP3 server URL - the server which handles yout mail
   delivery; Either your ISP or sys admin should be
   able to help you with that.
 - the e-mail address accounts, the user names and 
   passwords associated with each.
   

All wxMS settings are saved in the INI file wxMS.ini which will reside 
in one of the data directories. The exact path depends on the OS.

If you setup more than one identity for reporting SPAM, you can
select which identity to use for sending e-mail from the drop-
down box.

Unwanted or unused accounts can be deleted using the 'Delete"
button.

OPTIONS

Use the "Options" menu to configure the following items:

Preferences

General:
Launch the default e-mail client after processing: deletes of the messages
which have the check box in the 'Delete' column set.

Check e-mail at start up: As soon as the application is started, it will 
check the enabled accounts for messages.

Mail Check: This gives you the option to have wxMS check for new mail at
intervals selected by the 'minutes' spin control.

Check for new version at start up: Should wxMS contact the download server
to see if a newer version of the program is available.

Number of lines to retrieve in a TOP request: As part of the initial mail
check, wxMS only downloads the header information. Here you can specify
how many extra lines of the message body should be downloaded at the same 
time. There generally is no advantage to have extra lines downloaded and
it is best to simply leave this option at 0.

Log:


Filters:
In the filter Dialog you can set up conditions which the wxMS is to use to 
identify and possibly mark for deletion, some of the message lines displayed
in the main grid.

Also note that Filter option is merely a different pages in the Options 
notebook.

Accounts
In this dialog you can set up the information necessary for the POP3 mail
accounts you wish to handle using wxMS>
